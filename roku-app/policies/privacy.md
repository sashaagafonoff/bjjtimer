# BJJ Timer — Privacy Policy

**Effective date:** August 24, 2025

BJJ Timer is a simple timing app. We do **not** collect, store, or share personal data.

## What we collect
- **Nothing.** The channel/app does not ask you to sign in, does not track usage, and does not send data off the device.

## Device & platform data
Your Roku device and the Roku platform may collect limited, device-level information as part of normal operation (e.g., crash logs or device diagnostics). That data is handled by Roku under their own policies.

## Third parties
- **No analytics providers**
- **No advertising partners**
- **No SDKs that transmit data**

## Children’s privacy
Because we do not collect personal information, the app is suitable for all ages from a privacy perspective.

## Changes
If we make material changes to this policy, we will update this file and the “Effective date” above.
